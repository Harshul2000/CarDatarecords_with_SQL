In this, I have demonstrated the use of SQL Queries by using a  csv file, which is a database of cars. Here various queries have been run in MYSQL Workbench to find out data, like the amount of cars available in a year, number of cars which are diesel or petrol based,etc. All the commands are available in the code given below.
